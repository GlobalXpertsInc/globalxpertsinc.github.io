                Unified Communications (UC) enables the telecommuter and travelers in-transit to enjoy the same communications functionality as colleagues sitting at their desktops in terms of both access and visibility. This **“just as good as being there”** distributed communications environment speeds up collaborative business conferences and therefore the decision-making process.

                Unified Communications gracefully integrates communication technologies such as IP Telephony, unified messaging, instant messaging, presence, social networking, data & video conferencing and a host of other features into one cohesive solution that promotes connectedness throughout the company.

                At the heart of UC is IP Telephony (IPT) which has rapidly been replacing the legacy TDM switch. Technologies and tools are seamlessly integrated offering organizations rich communication features and performance across the enterprise.

                As a Gold Partner with Oracle Enterprise Communications, GlobalXperts is available to design and implement revenue protection and growth solutions such as Real Time Communications, IP Session Recording and Enterprise Operations Monitor. These tools are invaluable in support of rich and multimedia communications between your enterprise professionals and end user customers, matters of compliance and rapid IP/SIP problem identification, isolation and correction.

                These all become especially compelling drivers for service and operations focused organizations that place a high value on customer satisfaction “in the moment,” where high value users are in immediate need of skilled assistance. Swift and contextual support that aligns to customer preferences provides the level of stickiness required that reduces churn and drives revenue retention. **At GlobalXperts we like to say that communication problems are inevitable but customer exposure to those problems are optional.**
