          body: |+
                - **DISCOVERY:** GlobalXperts first identifies the inventory of current applications and their usage along with their platforms and license dependencies. We also identify the SLA’s, security, and compliance of various business applications.
                - **ANALYSIS:** By using industry best practices and the information gathered in the discovery phase, GlobalXperts cloud architects work with you to design the cloud architecture model to be deployed on the cloud.
                - **MIGRATION:** All the major layers of the system requirements, such as DNS, load balancers, web, application layers, database, storage, security, internal/external integrations, monitoring, backup, deployment, and background programs are migrated to cloud.
                - **VALIDATION:** We ensure that the systems have been migrated without loss of fidelity in functional and non-functional requirements.
