        title: Managed Network Operations
        body: |+
                Nowadays virtually all forward-looking companies have moved to or are planning to move to an **IP-based network platform** and use high-speed internet daily as part of their enterprise information technology solution. We are also aware that a minefield of potential bottlenecks or security intrusions lurks within the cloud that can drastically degrade network performance or even cause loss of critical data.

          body: |+
                Customers have **24/7 access** to GlobalXperts support services through our Remote Network Operations Center (RNOC). Highly skilled engineers stand ready to answer questions, diagnose customer networks and remotely troubleshoot & resolve any problem or service request directed to them. Our credentialed technical staff have experience and expertise with the leading communications vendors systems our customers utilize. Because of our specialization certification with Cisco Collaboration, we have even deeper expertise with their solutions. In addition to providing managed services to end user organizations, GlobalXperts provides end-to-end remote network and infrastructure support augmentation to solutions providers, VARS and integrators for their managed service practices.
        - title: Help Desk Support
          body: |+
                Like all technology-based solutions, information technology should not be constantly on a customer’s mind when using it for a video conference, voice call, email, fax or data storage; it should just be there and work every time. In the real world, things go wrong and hiccups disrupt the even flow of information which leads to loss of productivity and frustration. Mitigating downtime with fast and reliable corrective support can make the difference between a slight delay and a canceled international video conference.

                Many companies try to handle their entire help desk and support services in-house and for some, it works. For most, however, the cost of maintaining a highly trained and specialized staff at a 24/7 help desk is cost prohibitive especially given that the core strategic business operations of most companies are far removed from IT. Every organization must evaluate the cost of establishing a fully staffed help desk and support service capability versus partnering with a company that specializes in 24/7 technical support. GlobalXperts goal is to always be there when our customers reach out and to **deliver across-the-board support** for all their IT technology needs at a ROI that makes it possible.

                Each company has different Help Desk support needs as it pertains to incident, problem, and knowledge management requirements. When GlobalXperts partners with you, we pair our engineering staff with your technical staff to try to make business decisions on how to keep your enterprise solutions running as well as to maximize end-user support satisfaction. Whether it’s answering a service request, logging events or escalating a trouble ticket, our help desk staff is there to support our customers.
        - title: RNOC Support
          body: |+
                Our **24/7/365 RNOC** is fully equipped to monitor your SNMP-enabled IT infrastructure including but not limited to **workstations, routers, switches, servers, gateways,** and **firewalls**. Proactive monitoring identifies problems before they occur and **response is immediate** by one of our experienced engineers at the RNOC. For instance, we can see when CPU or memory utilization is long running or SQL transactions are blocked, disk space is running low, network is approaching saturation, abnormal event log activity and more.

                Our white label practice offers day-to-day management and monitoring of end-user customer network environments and maintaining network quality. **Service Level Agreements** are structured to meet your specific IT environment and level of augmentation requirements. These services include hardware and software monitoring and fault management performed by certified engineers. We are constantly looking at **bandwidth allocation, network availability/interface availability**, and other performance monitoring metrics to ensure that your network is always running at peak performance.

                The bulk of our engineers are graduates and virtually all have multiple industry certifications with **Microsoft, VMware, Cisco, Avaya, Nortel** and others. The RNOC maintains an in-house laboratory for not only duplicating and resolving fault signatures but also for training young engineers for advanced certifications. This has enabled us to stay ahead of the power curve in supporting advanced technology solutions found in Collaboration, Routing/Switching, Data Centers and Security.

                Our goal is to ensure that your IT systems are operational, available, and secure which allows you to focus on the core competencies of your business, controlling costs and growing revenues. The engineers at GlobalXperts evaluate data and performance statistics of monitored components and applications to provide you with accurate and actionable management reports.
